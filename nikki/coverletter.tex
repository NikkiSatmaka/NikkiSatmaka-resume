\lettersection{About Me}
I am Nikki Satmaka, and I am very excited when I heard there was an opening in your company for a Data Analyst position. I'm Skilled in deep data analysis processes and scientific data modeling. Trained in Python, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow Keras, and SQL. I also got 5+ years of hands-on experience in Business Analytics, Business Development, and Investment Analytics. I believe my mixtures of unique background would translate to sharper business acumen that can bring growth, values, and a fresh perspective in problem-solving and insight exploration as a Data Scientist in your company.

\lettersection{Why Rabobank?}
It's pretty clear that when we think of banking in the Netherlands, Rabobank would be the top of mind. Being one of the oldest bank, focusing with its roots in cooperative agricultural credit union, Rabobank continues its focus in growing a better world together.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
As an investment analyst and business development specialist at my previous company, I have extensive experience dealing with data and business challenges. One of the projects  I want to highlight is when I created an analysis and dashboard, which increased clarity on the kind of products our customers liked, so we could focus more on our strong point. This led to enormous increase in the number of projects and revenue generated. Tackling this project requires me to be resourceful and use leadership, communication, critical thinking, problem-solving, business planning, and business sense, qualities that are very beneficial as a Data Scientist in a data-related field.

I am also certified in data science technical skills which I learned by enrolling in the Full-Time Data Science Bootcamp at Hacktiv8. I also went on to further enhance my knowledge by taking the Google Data Analytics Course at Coursera.

I believe both my business experience and technical skills would provide unique value and perspective to help your team bring growth. I'm very interested to join your company, which I share the values of diversity and collaboration. If you are aware of any other vacancy that might be more suitable in your company, I am open to further discussion. Feel free to reach out.
